# GUI_Software_Submission_2025

**General:**

For the General Questionnaire and the responses to the questions, go to the 'TAH GUI app_ED24B051_General and Technical Questionnaire Response.pdf' file.

For Q1, go to 'Q1_final' folder.

For Q2, go to the 'Question 2' section of the pdf; For the bonus part-4, go to 'Q2_part-4_paho-mqtt' folder.

**Approach and Thought process, for Q1:**

I have kept in mind the need for a lightweight, yet informative dashboard tool while creating the Streamlit user interface for Question-1. As exemplified in the 'Q1_old' folder, I initially used a sidebar with radio buttons attached for the concept of a lightweight application, then switched to the current use of Navigation panels and modular code in the 'pages' directory, as exemplified in the 'Q1_final' folder, which I consider to be my final submission.
